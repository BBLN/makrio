        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is to provide an easy way for anyone to discover their creative voice; their inner-Makr. When we collaborate with others, new ideas and inspiration can emerge. We view remixing as a cultural tool that continues the spread of ideas, creativity and inspiration for others to take and build upon. <a href='http://makriohq.tumblr.com/post/28562322358/welcome-to-makr-io' target="_blank">Read more about Makr culture.</a>

        <h2><span;>Our Mission</span></h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is to provide an easy way for anyone to discover their creative voice; their inner-Makr. When we collaborate with others, new ideas and inspiration can emerge. We view remixing as a cultural tool that continues the spread of ideas, creativity and inspiration for others to take and build upon. <a href='http://makriohq.tumblr.com/post/28562322358/welcome-to-makr-io' target="_blank">Read more about Makr culture.</a>

          Makr is the place for simple, creative collaboration.

        <h2>What is a Remix on Makr?</h2>
        <p>
          A remix is a combination of image and text selected by you and posted to Makr. A remix can be added from the web, your computer, or built on an existing Makr post. A remix can be a comment or interpretation on an existing post, and can create an entirely new conversation.        
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h2>How do you Remix?</h2>
        <p>
          You can remix any post on the Makr site—all you need to do is hover over a post and click on the remix icon, and you can then change the post’s image, text or both! Don’t forget you can also remix anywhere on the web—just <a href=''>install the Remix button</a> to your bookmarks bar.        
        </p>

You can start a topic thread yourself, or you can explore and join an existing one created by someone in the Makr community.
